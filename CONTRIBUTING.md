# How to contribute

## Dependencies

We use `poetry` to manage
the [dependencies](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry). If you don't
have `poetry`, you should install with `make poetry-download`.

To install dependencies and prepare [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/)
hooks you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell`.

## Codestyle

After installation, you may execute code formatting.

```bash
make codestyle
```

### Checks

Many checks are configured for this project. Command `make check-codestyle`
will check black, isort and darglint.

Command `make lint` applies all checks.

### Before submitting

Before submitting your code please do the following steps:

1. Add any changes you want
1. Add tests for the new changes
1. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
1. Run `make codestyle` to format your changes.
1. Run `make lint` to ensure that types, security and docstrings are okay.

## Other help

You can contribute by spreading a word about this library. It would also be a
huge contribution to write a short article on how you are using this project.
You can also share your best practices with us.

## Detailed Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/pksol/pytest-mock-generator/blob/master/Makefile)
contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks could be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Tests</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Or to remove pycache and build run:

```bash
make clean-all
```

</p>
</details>

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish ðŸ™‚ `poetry publish --build`

## ðŸ“ˆ Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pksol/pytest-mock-generator/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

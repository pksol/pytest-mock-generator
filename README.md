A pytest fixture wrapper for https://pypi.org/project/mock-generator

</div>

## Installation

```bash
pip install pytest-mock-generator
```

or install with [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry):

```bash
poetry add pytest-mock-generator
```

## Usage
This [pytest plugin](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/writing_plugins.html) 
adds the `mg` [fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/fixtures.html#fixture)
which helps when writing tests that use [python mocks](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.mock.html).

Let's start with an easy example. Assume you have a module named `tested_module.py` which holds a function
to process a string sent to it and then add it to a zip file:
```python
import zipfile

def process_and_zip(zip_path, file_name, contents):
    processed_contents = "processed " + contents  # some complex logic
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'w') as zip_container:
        zip_container.writestr(file_name, processed_contents)
```
This is the unit under test, or UUT.

Although this is a very short function, 
writing the test code takes a lot of time. It's the fact that the function uses
a context manager makes the testing more complex than it should be.
*If you don't believe me, try to manually write mocks and asserts which verify
that `zip_container.writestr` was called with the right parameters.*

In any case, you start with a test skeleton:

```python
from tests.sample.code.tested_module import process_and_zip

def test_process_and_zip(mocker, mg):
    # Arrange: todo  
    
    # Act: invoking the tested code
    process_and_zip('/path/to.zip', 'in_zip.txt', 'foo bar')
    
    # Assert: todo
```
Now it's time to use Mock Generator instead of manually writing the 'Arrange' 
and 'Assert' sections.

### Generating the 'Arrange' section
To generate the 'Arrange' section, simply put this code at the beginning of 
your test function skeleton and run it (make sure to add the `mg` fixture to 
your test function):
```python
mg.generate_uut_mocks(process_and_zip)
```
This will generate the 'Arrange' section for you:
```python
# mocked dependencies
mock_ZipFile = mocker.MagicMock(name='ZipFile')
mocker.patch('tests.sample.code.tested_module.zipfile.ZipFile', new=mock_ZipFile)
```
<b>The generated code is returned, printed to the console and also copied to the
clipboard for your convenience. 
Just paste it (as simple as ctrl+V) at the start of your test function:</b>
```python
from tests.sample.code.tested_module import process_and_zip

def test_process_and_zip(mocker, mg):
    # mocked dependencies
    mock_ZipFile = mocker.MagicMock(name='ZipFile')
    mocker.patch('tests.sample.code.tested_module.zipfile.ZipFile', new=mock_ZipFile)
    
    # Act: invoking the tested code
    process_and_zip('/path/to.zip', 'in_zip.txt', 'foo bar')
    
    # Assert: todo
```

Excellent! Arrange section is ready.

### Generating the Assert section
Now it's time to add the asserts. Add the following code
**at the 'Assert'** step:
```python
mg.generate_asserts(mock_ZipFile)
```
The `mock_ZipFile` is the mock object you generated earlier.
Now execute the test function to get the assert section: 
```python
assert 1 == mock_ZipFile.call_count
mock_ZipFile.assert_called_once_with('/path/to.zip', 'w')
mock_ZipFile.return_value.__enter__.assert_called_once_with()
mock_ZipFile.return_value.__enter__.return_value.writestr.assert_called_once_with('in_zip.txt', 'processed foo bar')
mock_ZipFile.return_value.__exit__.assert_called_once_with(None, None, None)
```
Wow, that's a handful of asserts! Some are very useful: 
* Checking that we opened the zip file with the right parameters.
* Checking that we wrote the correct data to the proper file.
* Finally, ensuring that `__enter__` and `__exit__` are called, so there 
are no open file handles which could cause problems.

You can remove any generated line which you find unnecessary.   

Paste that code right after the act phase, and you're done!

The complete test function:
```python
from tests.sample.code.tested_module import process_and_zip

def test_process_and_zip(mocker):
    # mocked dependencies
    mock_ZipFile = mocker.MagicMock(name='ZipFile')
    mocker.patch('tests.sample.code.tested_module.zipfile.ZipFile', new=mock_ZipFile)
    
    # Act: invoking the tested code
    process_and_zip('/path/to.zip', 'in_zip.txt', 'foo bar')
    
    assert 1 == mock_ZipFile.call_count
    mock_ZipFile.assert_called_once_with('/path/to.zip', 'w')
    mock_ZipFile.return_value.__enter__.assert_called_once_with()
    mock_ZipFile.return_value.__enter__.return_value.writestr.assert_called_once_with('in_zip.txt', 'processed foo bar')
    mock_ZipFile.return_value.__exit__.assert_called_once_with(None, None, None)
```
Can you imagine the time it would have taken you to code this on your own?

### What's Next
#### Asserting Existing Mocks
At times, you may be editing a test code already containing mocks, or
you choose to write the mocks yourself, to gain some extra control.

Mock Generator can generate the assert section for standard 
Python mocks, even if they were not created using the Mock Generator. 

Put this after the 'Act' (replace `mock_obj` with your mock object name): 
```python
mg.generate_asserts(mock_obj)
```
Take the generated code and paste it at the 'Assert' section. 

#### Generating the 'Arrange' and 'Assert' sections in one call
You can make the `generate_uut_mocks_with_asserts` call create the 
`generate_asserts` code for you (instead of having to call 
`generate_uut_mocks`):
```python
mg.generate_uut_mocks_with_asserts(function_under_test)
```
